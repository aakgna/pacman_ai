Pacman Phase 1 Auxiliary Questions:
1. Is the exploration order what you would have expected?
    The exploration order made sense because there was earlier exploration close to the start state, and it gradually moves into later exploration towards the end.
2. Does Pacman actually go to all the explored squares on his way to the goal?
    No, the Pacman does not actually go to all the explored squares on his way to the goal. It uses the explored squares to determine whether taking that path would result in a dead end or not, thus determining whether it is an acceptable path that can reach the goal.
